Understand

Provide short answers to the following questions:

	1. 1NF is when all database attribute values are broken down into their smallest form and only contain one value. 2NF is when a database is already in 1NF, and there is no partial functional dependency. A database is in 3NF when it is already in 2NF, and every non prime attribute is non-transitively dependent on superkey of relation.

	2. A set of guidelines given for structuring databases.

	3. Truncate doesn't immediately remove the data in the tables, rather it removes all references to it until it is overwritten, or the table is shrunk.
