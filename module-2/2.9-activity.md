1. The benefit of using 'case' over chained 'if' statements would be simplicity, as you don't need to be as explicit in the conditional trigger, only if it is set or unset.

2. 'If' statements are more powerful than 'case' statements because you can be more explicit with 'if' statements allowing you to specify more conditional triggers for a value.
