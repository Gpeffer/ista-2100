Remember

Fill in the blanks:

	1. shebang
	2. "${}"; ``
	3. unset
	4. locally
	5. man read | grep "parameter expansion"

Understand

Provide short answers to the following questions:

	1. ##; %%
	2. chmod 776 (assuming you want all permission minus the execute bit for everyone else); chmod ug+x
	3. '[' is preferred for portability

Apply

	for file in *.md; do echo "${file}"; cat "${file}"; done
