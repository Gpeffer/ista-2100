1. 'for loop': for var in file1 file2 file3
		do
			command1 on $var
			command2
			commandN

'while loop': while [["${var}" = "$0" ]]
		do
			command1
			command2
			command3

2. 'For loop' would be preferred over a 'while loop' for incorporating multiple conditionals/files in a condensed syntax.

3. 'While loop' would be preferred over a 'for loop' if the subcommands are less specific or geared more towards the variable remaining true.
